# sumPrimes

sum all prime number which are less than or equal to N;

Method 1:

define a number whether is a prime number

and then sum all prime number

Method 2;

suppose N = 7

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

we find 2 is a prime number, and set the number is multiples of 2 to 0

[0,2,3,0,5,0,7]

we find 3 is not set to 0, so 3 is a prime number, and set the number is multiples of 3 to 0

[0,2,3,0,5,0,7]

5,7 are prime numbers

sum = 17
